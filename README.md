# TUF AX6000 custom OpenWrt firmware builder

This repository automates the process of building OpenWrt custom firmware images for **MY** Flint 2 (GL-MT6000) router, based on **MY PREFERENCES** and [pesa1234](https://github.com/pesa1234)'s work.

You should **not use** the firmwares released in this repository unless you have the same preferences/needs.
Instead, **make a fork and adapt to your needs**.

Read [this topic](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/mt6000-custom-build-with-luci-and-some-optimization-kernel-6-12-x/185241) in OpenWrt's forum to learn the details about pesa1234's customizations.

Compared to his custom firmware, this firmware adds:
- **WiFi UCODE scripts** (faster boot)
- **Wireguard VPN**
- **Policy Based Routing** (select what goes through VPN and what not)
- **AdBlock Fast** (ads and malware blocking at DNS level)
- **Custom Attended Sysupgrade** (install custom firmware from GitHub)

And also:
- **REMOVED:** odhcp, upnp, iptables, avahi, samba, usb storage and probably more stuff I forgot to mention.
- Added the needed packages to use QoS script [cake-wg-pbr](https://github.com/lynxthecat/cake-wg-pbr)
- Some compiler optimizations and build hardening options (cortex-a53+crc+crypto; LTO, MOLD, and more).
- SSH configuration with strong algorithms and key exchange methods. Check the content of [`ssh_hardening.config`](files/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ssh_hardening.conf) and [`sshd_config`](files/etc/ssh/sshd_config).
- Quality-of-life enhancements through UCI configuration. Check the content of [`999-QOL_config`](files/etc/uci-defaults/999-QOL_config).
- Some debug and kernel stuff removed.
- [`upgrade_custom_openwrt`](files/usr/bin/upgrade_custom_openwrt) script

Check the content of [`mt6000.config`](mt6000.config) for details.



## About Custom Attended Sysupgrade

Using Luci's menu "System" --> "Attended Sysupgrade" it is now possible to select and install custom firmware from GitHub.

## About upgrade_custom_openwrt script

```
THIS IS NOW DEPRECATED, ALTHOUGHT THE SCRIPT IS STILL INCLUDED
```

I added a script to make upgrading OpenWRT super easy. Just run from a SSH terminal:
- `upgrade_custom_openwrt --now` to check if a newer firmware is available and upgrade if so.
- `upgrade_custom_openwrt --wait` to wait for clients activity to stop before upgrading.
- `upgrade_custom_openwrt --check` to check for new versions but not upgrade the router.

**IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED** to schedule the script to be executed automatically, although the script is very careful and checks sha256sums before trying to upgrade. Don't blame me if something goes wrong with scripts that **YOU** run in your router!

Notes:
- if you fork this repository, the script will be adapted to look for upgrades in your repository.
- The text output of upgrade_custom_openwrt script will show both in terminal and system logs.



## About SSH Hardening

To enhance the security of SSH connections, this firmware includes a hardened SSH configuration. The configuration is derived from recommendations by [SSH-Audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit) and the [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/), it specifies strong key exchange algorithms, ciphers, message authentication codes (MACs), host key algorithms, and public key algorithms. This ensures that only secure and up-to-date algorithms are used for SSH communication.
